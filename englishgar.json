At least when it comes to the use of the words "should," "could," and "could," there is little difference. They have somewhat distinct meanings, but switching them around wouldn't matter much.</p><p><br /></p> <p>Things with power or authority to act are indicated by the word "can." While "may" is similar to "can," but it has a stronger sense of freedom than "can". When someone says, "You may eat chocolate," they're implying more than just capacity; they're also granting you permission to eat the chocolate.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>The word "may" is more strongly suggestive of permission than the common "can" used by many English speakers. The word "may" combines elements of "can" and "could" or "would." Assume that something is not required to occur, but is still possible.</p><p><br /></p> <p>The word "must" indicates an obligatory action. In a negative sense, it implies "don't have to," which is a complete reversal.</p> <p>"I have to go" = "I must eat."</p> <p>The expressions "I don't have to go" and "I must not go" have different meanings.</p> <p>Historically, the original subjunctive moods of will/want and ability were would and could, respectively.</p> <p><br /></p><p><b>Simple logical trick-</b></p> <p>Use should - when 80% Chances are there</p> <p>Use Might - when 50% chances are there</p> <p>Use would - for conditional statements</p> <p>Use must - used for present and future reference to express obligation, give orders and give advice.</p> <p>Use could - when there is a option</p><p><br /></p> <p><strong>A.

After his arrival, one of his first tasks was to find an apartment close to work, as he did not have a car. Usually, there are many different places to choose from, and he considers cost, location, and luxury. If one apartment has a washing machine and dryer and 
costs four hundred dollars a month, he prefers to rent it over another apartment which has significantly less rent and is located two blocks from a Laundromat. Rob's family never wanted to live in an apartment on the thirteenth floor, since all of them fear heights. He also tried to choose an apartment with a landlord recommended by former tenants. Everybody knows that it is important to find a responsible landlord. Rob and his wife love to cook together when both are free, so they need a spacious, well-equipped kitchen. Rob often looks for a place with an air conditioner because there are so many scorching days and nights in Arizona. Whenever Rob finds a new apartment, all of his concerns disappear.

It is also called adjective of adjectives. Most adverbs end with "-ly," but some, like "well," "fast," "late," "early," etc., do not.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p> <p>Here are a few common examples:</p> <ul> <li>He moved quickly.</li> <li>Elegantly, she sings.</li> <li>I replied instantly.</li> <li>He spoke loudly.</li> <li>They danced enthusiastically.</li> </ul><div><br /></div> <p>There are many kinds of adverbs. But, the one that we need to understand in this chapter, is frequency adverb.</p> <p>Frequency adverb is used to indicate how much time or how often an action occurs. Some common frequency adverbs include "always," "usually," "often," "sometimes," "rarely," and "never."</p><p><br /></p> <p>1. In a sentence frequency adverbs usually come before the main verb. But they come after the auxiliary verb if there is one. For example:</p> <p>She always goes to the gym. ("always" comes before the main verb "goes")</p> <p>They are usually late. ("usually" comes after the auxiliary verb "are")</p><p><br /></p> <p>2. If there is no auxiliary verb in the sentence, the frequency adverb comes after the subject and before the main verb. For example:</p> <p>He rarely eats meat. ("rarely" comes after the subject "he" and before the main verb "eats")</p><p><br /></p> <p>3. Avoid double negatives in a sentnce. It is not grammatically correct to use a negative frequency adverb (such as "never") with a negative verb.&nbsp;</p> <p>For example, "I never don't eat vegetables" is incorrect!&nbsp;</p> <p>We need to use "I never eat vegetables".</p><p><br /></p> <p>4.

When referring to events that took place before this particular instant, i.e., before the current time, the simple past tense is the most appropriate verb tense to use.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p> <p>The past tense is used to talk about things that already happened or things that happened in the past.&nbsp;In English, when we want to talk about an action that started and ended in the past, we usually add "ed" to the end of the word. For example, "I dreamed" or "I walked" become "I dreamed" or "I walked," respectively.</p><p><br /></p> <p><strong>General Formula of Past Tense:&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>The past tense takes us on a journey back in time, where we can explore completed actions, ongoing events, and past states. With four main tenses to choose from, let's take a quick look at each one and their secret formula.</p> <p><br /></p><p>First up, the simple past tense - it's perfect for recounting those finished events in the past. Simply put, you need your Subject + Verb (past tense) + Object to create a sentence like "She walked to the store yesterday."</p><p><br /></p> <p>Next, we have the past continuous tense, which captures the ongoing actions that happened at a specific time in the past. You'll need to add was/were + Verb (present participle) + Object to create a sentence like "They were playing football at 5 pm yesterday."</p><p><br /></p> <p>The past perfect tense is a handy tool when you want to describe actions that were completed before another event took place. All you need is Subject + had + Verb (past participle) + Object, and you're ready to go! For example, "By the time I arrived, she had already left."</p><p><br /></p> <p>Last but not least, we have the past perfect continuous tense, which takes us on a journey through the ongoing actions that started in the past and continued until another time in the past. To use this tense, simply use Subject + had been + Verb (present participle) + Object, like "He had been studying for three hours when I arrived."</p><p><br /></p> <p>In short, the past tense is a time machine that allows us to relive the past. By using the correct tense and formula, we can accurately describe past events and avoid any confusion to describe the already happened incidents.</p><p><br /></p> <p><strong>Textbook Solution:</strong></p> <p>B.

They're like the bridge that links your favorite nouns, pronouns, and phrases to other words in a sentence. With prepositions, you can show the relationship between things like location, direction, time, manner, or amount. So if you want to avoid confusing your readers, be sure to sprinkle in prepositions like "of," "at," "in," "by," and "to."</p><p><br /></p> <p>But the importance of prepositions goes beyond just making sentences clear. In fact, understanding these little powerhouses is crucial for acing standardized tests like the ACT and SAT. Knowing your parts of speech and how they work together can help you answer tricky grammar and syntax questions and score big.</p><p><br /></p> <p>And let's not forget that mastering prepositions is essential for improving your language skills. Once you've got the basics down, you'll be able to take on even the most complex sentences and communicate like a pro.

If you're an advanced student, it may be a real nightmare.</p> <p>There is a mnemonic that some people use: <strong>DOSAS COMP.</strong></p> <p><strong>Trick: DOSASCOMP</strong></p><p><strong><br /></strong></p> <p>If you count "Determiner," there are nine places in English for adjectives, including things like "five," "a," "the," "his," "her," "many," "many," etc.</p> <p>When it comes to using multiple adjectives to describe a noun, it can be confusing. It can be tricky to remember the correct order. But, there's a helpful trick you can use to make it easier.</p> <p>Just remember the code OSASCOMP. It means Opinion, Size, Age, Shape, Color, Origin, Material, Purpose.</p><p><br /></p> <p>This means that when you have multiple adjectives, you should list them in the following order:</p> <p>Opinion - an adjective that describes your opinion or attitude towards the noun.</p> <p>Size - an adjective that describes the size of the noun.</p> <p>Age - an adjective that describes the age of the noun.</p> <p>Shape - an adjective that describes the shape of the noun.</p> <p>Color - an adjective that describes the color of the noun.</p> <p>Origin - an adjective that describes the origin or nationality of the noun.</p> <p>Material - an adjective that describes the material the noun is made of.</p> <p>Purpose - an adjective that describes the purpose or use of the noun.</p><p><br /></p> <p>So, if you want to describe a beautiful small old round red Italian leather purse, the correct order would be: Opinion (beautiful) + Size (small) + Age (old) + Shape (round) + Color (red) + Origin (Italian) + Material (leather) + Purpose (purse).</p><p><br /></p> <p>Using this trick can make it much easier to remember the correct order of multiple adjectives.
